## LangChain

LangChain is a python framework used to integrate and interact with LLM models. It provides an abstraction to LLM models.

LangChain is based on chains which means, basically an action, after an action, after an action, and so on. So if you want to perform actions with the LLM, then Langchain offers us an elegant solution to do so without any effort.

## Components
#### Prompts
> Prompt is simply text input that we give to the LLM and LLM processes it and returns us  an output

#### PromptTemplate
> It's simply a wrapper class around a prompt

#### Chat Model
> It's a way to interact with LLM

#### Chain
> Allow us to combine multiple components together and create one single coherent application

## LangChain

LangChain is a python framework used to integrate and interact with LLM models. It provides an abstraction to LLM models.

LangChain is based on chains which means, basically an action, after an action, after an action, and so on. So if you want to perform actions with the LLM, then Langchain offers us an elegant solution to do so without any effort.
